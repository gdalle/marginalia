- Workflow updates:
  - Project.toml + compat anstelle von Project.toml+ Manifest.
    Manifest nur wenn exakte versionen wirklich erforderlich sind
  - PackageNursery: Hungarian Notation names in order to distinguish
    budding package from real one => allow for full semver already
    at devElopment stage.
    LiquidElectrolytesPrototype etc.

- Unionize your collections!
When working e.g with agent based models or finite elements with varying element geometries 
a common pattern is the occurence of collections of objects of different types on which one
wants to perform certain actions depending on their type. Likewise 

- useful packages:
  LaTeXDatax
  MethodAnalysis
