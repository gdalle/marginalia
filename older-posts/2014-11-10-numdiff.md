# File differencing for  numerical output
(2014-11-10)

In software unit tests we have the problem that the usual diff command
fails   when   comparing   output   files   generated   by   numerical
algorithms. Tolerable numerical differences in the output are still
hard differnces. [Numdiff](http://www.nongnu.org/numdiff/) may help.

It    is    free    software    and it source code   can    be    downloaded    from
[http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/numdiff](http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/numdiff).

Among other features it allows to compare numbers in output files with
a given tolerance.

## Example

Assume we have two files:
`a.txt`

````
x=3.150303334
y=4.59993e-3
````

and `b.txt`

````
x=3.15030333
y=4.59994e-3
````

We assume  that the differences  are tolerably  small, and we  want to
have  a differencing  tool which  acknowledges  this. But  this is  the
output of the system `diff` command:

````
$ if diff a.txt b.txt ; then echo EQUAL ; else echo DIFFER ; fi
1,2c1,2
< x=3.150303334
< y=4.59993e-3
---
> x=3.15030333
> y=4.59994e-3
DIFFER
````

With `numdiff` we can do the following:
````
$ numdiff a.txt b.txt
----------------
##1       #:1   <== x=3.150303334
##1       #:1   ==> x=3.15030333
@                                                     @@
----------------
##2       #:1   <== y=4.59993e-3
##2       #:1   ==> y=4.59994e-3
@                                                     @@

+++  File "a.txt" differs from file "b.txt"
````

Ok, we had this. So let us introduce the (relative) tolerance:

````
$ numdiff -r 1.0e-3 a.txt b.txt
----------------
##1       #:1   <== x=3.150303334
##1       #:1   ==> x=3.15030333
@                                                     @@
----------------
##2       #:1   <== y=4.59993e-3
##2       #:1   ==> y=4.59994e-3
@                                                     @@

+++  File "a.txt" differs from file "b.txt"
````

Ups? Ok. The manual says:

````
-s, --separators=IFS

   Specify the set of characters  to use as delimiters while splitting
   the  input lines  into fields  (The  default set  of delimiters  is
   space, tab and newline).  If IFS is prefixed with 1: or 2: then use
   the given  delimiter set only for  the lines from the  first or the
   second file respectively


````




So we should add `=` to the delimiter list:

````
$ numdiff -s "\n ="  -r 1.0e-5 a.txt b.txt 

+++  Files "a.txt" and "b.txt" are equal
````
This is what we expected.

A stronger tolerance gives:

````
$ numdiff -s "\n ="  -r 1.0e-16 a.txt b.txt 
----------------
##1       #:2   <== 3.150303334
##1       #:2   ==> 3.15030333
@ Absolute error = 4.0000000000e-9, Relative error = 1.2697190019e-9
----------------
##2       #:2   <== 4.59993e-3
##2       #:2   ==> 4.59994e-3
@ Absolute error = 1.0000000000e-8, Relative error = 2.1739461253e-6

+++  File "a.txt" differs from file "b.txt"
````

Very informative. Note that the return code from `numdiff` can be
used as with `diff` (see above) for reacting on the various results.
