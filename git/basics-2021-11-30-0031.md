## Version control

[Version   control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)  in software development consists  in recording all changes  in the source  code with the help of a *version control system* (VCS), a collection of software tools which manage versioning and collaboration in software development.

Version control allows  to track all changes in a  software system, to manage different  development branches, to organize  the collaboration of developers.  In the case  of research software, version  control is becoming an indispensible tool to maintain Good Scientific Practice.





### Centralized version control systems

Centralized version control systems like [subversion (svn)](https://subversion.apache.org/) work based on the client-server priciple. Developers check out working copies from a central server, and commit the changes back to that server after work has been finished.


### [Distributed version control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control)

Distributed version control systems like [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) are organized after the peer-to-peer principle. Instead of a working copy containing only a current version, users maintain *clones* of repositories, each of them containing the full history of the code. While it is possible to emulate the centralized model with this approach, the additional flexibility of this model has many [advantages](https://rhodecode.com/blog/62/why-embrace-distributed-version-control-systems).


## Git

Git  was intiated by Linus Torvalds and as of now (2021) became the de-facto standard for source code management systems.
